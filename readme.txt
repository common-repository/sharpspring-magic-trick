This plugin will create the pages for the SharpSpring Magic Trick on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

This plugin will automatically create the pages needed to set up the SharpSpring Magic Trick on your WordPress site! In addition to activating this plugin, you will need to install the Magic Trick on your SharpSpring instance by going to Settings -> Magic Trick (Under Agency Tools, if you are a direct client or agency partner you will not see this).

SharpSpring.com

== Installation ==

1. Activating the app will create four new pages and new rewrite rules for the permalink engine.
2. You may want to hide the Magic Trick pages from any menus on your site.
3. You may wish to turn on the permalink engine by going to your WordPress settings, Permalinks, and selecting any option other than "Plain". This will allow the Magic Trick pages to be found at yourdomain.com/magic-trick/ which is where the default settings in SharpSpring expect them to be at
4. If you have not, install the Magic Trick on your SharpSpring instance by going to Settings -> Magic Trick.
5. Ensure that SharpSpring tracking is set up correctly on your website. In your SharpSpring app go to Settings -> Sites to set up tracking, or use the SharpSpring WordPress plugin and your API credentials to have your tracking code placed on every page for you (Note:This SharpSpring tracking code app was not developed by SharpSpring Inc.).

As always, free support is available by clicking the "?" in the upper right-hand corner of your SharpSpring instance. Happy Marketing Automation!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've set up the pages, but the SharpSpring app won't show any visits to my website! =

Ensure that you have correctly placed the tracking code in your website. To find your tracking code, in your SharpSpring app go to Settings -> Sites and make sure you have everything set up correctly.

Alternatively, you can use the SharpSpring WordPress plugin and your API credentials to have your tracking code placed on every page for you. Search the WordPress Plugin directory to find this (Note:This SharpSpring tracking code app was not developed by SharpSpring Inc.).

= What if I use the Plain option in WordPress's Permalinks settings? =

Using the Plain option will turn off WordPress's rewrite engine, and the Magic Trick pages will not be able to exist at yourdomain.com/magic-trick

= Can I create my own Magic Trick pages, or customize the ones that are made? =

Yes, of course you can do so! This plugin is meant to get the Magic Trick up and running quickly, but you may want to manually create the pages if you want them to exist in a different location on your site.

= The Magic Trick automations are not working! What do I do? =

Look for solutions to common problems in your SharpSpring app by going to Settings -> Magic Trick (under Agency Tools).
